DIGICHQ 

Idea: A portal through which "cheque process" is digitalized.

* It is a third party web portal where a Payer can transfer amount from on his multiple account from different banks.
* It helps the payee to select the bank to which the amount sent by the payer can be credited.
* In this on the payer side a pin is generated which is sent to the payee through email, using which the payee can credit the amount to his account.
